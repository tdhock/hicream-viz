The figure above shows a small subset of pixels, with different colors for four clusters.
We see that the cluster polygons are consistent with the pixel tiles.
For each cluster we see

- number of rows used to represent the polygon border.
- number of rows used to represent pixel tiles,
- and number of corners which required to represent tiles as polygons, if rotated 45 degrees.
- the numbers of rows are similar in the different representations (at least for this example).
