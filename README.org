Figure above shows that animint2 does not support drawing a polygon with holes, [[https://github.com/animint/animint2/issues/252][filed an issue]].

Figure above shows that ggplot2 does support drawing a polygon with holes, computed via either contourLines() or isoband::isobands().
Interface is aes(subgroup).

Work-around that we can use in the short term in this project: change geom_polygon(fill="transparent") to geom_path() (no fill), which only draws the borders, which are correct, example: [[https://tdhock.github.io/2025-10-09-HiC-pixels-chr1-zoom-tiles-clusters-sizes/][data viz with selector for cluster size]].

The figure above shows a small subset of pixels, with different colors for four clusters.
We see that the cluster polygons are consistent with the pixel tiles.
For each cluster we see

- number of rows used to represent the polygon border.
- number of rows used to represent pixel tiles,
- and number of corners which required to represent tiles as polygons, if rotated 45 degrees.
- the numbers of rows are similar in the different representations (at least for this example).
